## Why?

## üöÄ Quick Start

* Click on the chrome extension [link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/found-email/jndpjdoikpdclfhmhmakhcfbieonkfbd?hl=en&authuser=0)
* Add the chrome extension
* Go to a webpage of your choosing
* Click on the chrome extension icon to see if there is any email on the webpage
* Click on the clipboard icon to copy the email
